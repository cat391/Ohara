## Problem Solved 🚀

As online notes expand across folders and formats, locating a specific fact becomes time-consuming and confusing. Conventional keyword search provides limited context in large note directories, such as Obsidian vaults. Ohara is designed to eliminate that wasted time and provide a way to chat with your notes. Ohara is optimized for Obsidian vaults, but can also work with text/markdown files.
