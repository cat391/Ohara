**Course:** Introduction to Meteorology  
**Topic:** Cloud Types, Formation, and Weather Implications

## 1. Overview of Clouds

- **Definition:** Clouds are visible aggregations of water droplets and ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.
- **Role in Weather:**
  - Reflect solar radiation (albedo effect)
  - Influence precipitation patterns
  - Indicate atmospheric stability/instability

---

## 2. Cloud Formation Process

1. **Moisture Source**

   - Evaporation from oceans, lakes, and soils
   - Transpiration from vegetation

2. **Cooling Mechanisms**

   - **Adiabatic cooling:** Rising air expands and cools
   - **Radiative cooling:** Ground/air loses heat at night
   - **Frontal lifting:** Warm air forced over cooler air at a front
   - **Orographic lifting:** Air forced up terrain (e.g., mountains)
   - **Convergence:** Horizontal airflow collides, forcing uplift

3. **Condensation Nuclei**

   - Tiny particles (dust, salt, pollen) that water vapor condenses onto
   - Without nuclei, condensation would require relative humidity >200%

4. **Condensation / Deposition**
   - When air cools to its dew point, vapor ⇢ liquid (condensation) or solid (deposition at very cold temperatures)
   - Cloud droplet radius: 5–50 μm
   - Ice crystal formation above ~–10 °C, depending on supersaturation

## 3. Cloud Classification (Genus-Level)

Clouds are classified by **height** and **appearance**. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines ten principal genera.

### 3.1 High-Level Clouds (Cirro- Prefix)

(Above 6,000 m / 20,000 ft)

- **Cirrus (Ci)**

  - Thin, wispy filaments (“mares’ tails”)
  - Composed entirely of ice crystals
  - Indicate jet stream winds, fair weather but can presage storms 24–48 h ahead

- **Cirrostratus (Cs)**

  - Nearly transparent, whitish veil covering the sky
  - Can produce halo phenomena around the Sun or Moon
  - Often precede warm fronts

- **Cirrocumulus (Cc)**
  - Small, white patches in rippled or tufted sheets
  - “Mackerel sky” appearance
  - Often associated with fair but cold weather

### 3.2 Mid-Level Clouds (Alto- Prefix)

(2,000 m – 6,000 m / 6,500 ft – 20,000 ft)

- **Altostratus (As)**

  - Gray or blue-gray sheet, sun/moon outline may be dimly visible
  - Typically precedes continuous rain or snow

- **Altocumulus (Ac)**

  - White or gray patches in rounded masses or rolls
  - Mackerel-sky pattern at mid-level
  - “Altocumulus castellanus” (tall turrets) can indicate instability & afternoon thunderstorms

- **Nimbostratus (Ns)**
  - Thick, dark gray sheet producing steady precipitation
  - Usually no virga; precipitation reaches the ground
  - No distinct cloud base; uniform appearance

### 3.3 Low-Level Clouds (Strato- / Cumulus)

(Below 2,000 m / 6,500 ft)

- **Stratus (St)**

  - Uniform gray layer, sometimes ground-hugging as fog
  - Light drizzle or flurries possible
  - Often forms in stable air with weak vertical motion

- **Stratocumulus (Sc)**

  - Low, lumpy patches or rolls, can have breaks of clear sky
  - Light precipitation (drizzle or snow grains) at times
  - Appear in spreading patterns, often after a cold front

- **Cumulus (Cu)**
  - Detached, fluffy “cotton-ball” clouds with flat bases
  - Develop by daytime convection in fair weather (“cumulus humilis”)
  - If they grow vertically, become **Cumulus congestus** (towering cumulus)

### 3.4 Vertical Development Clouds

- **Cumulus Congestus (Cu con)**

  - Towering, cauliflower-like turrets
  - Can produce showers and gusty winds

- **Cumulonimbus (Cb)**
  - Enormous thunderstorm clouds, from low levels to the tropopause
  - Anvil-shaped top (anvil head) spread by strong upper-level winds
  - Potential for heavy rain, hail, lightning, downbursts, tornadoes

---

## 4. Sub-Classification (Species & Varieties)

- **Species** describe detailed forms (e.g., floccus, humilis, castellanus, congestus, fractus).

  - Example: _Cirrus fibratus_ (thin, fibrous streaks) vs. _Cirrus uncinus_ (“mares’ tail” hooks).

- **Varieties** describe transparency/arrangement (e.g., translucidus, opacus, undulatus, radiatus, perlucidus).
  - _Altocumulus undulatus_ – wavelike bands at mid-level.
  - _Stratocumulus radiatus_ – bands converging to a vanishing point.

---

## 5. Special Cloud Features & Accessory Clouds

- **Anvil (Incus):**

  - Flat, spreading top of a cumulonimbus shaped by upper-level winds.

- **Pileus (“Cap Cloud”):**

  - Smooth, cap-like cloud above a growing cumulus or cumulonimbus; indicates strong updraft.

- **Mammatus:**

  - Pouch-like structures underneath a cumulonimbus anvil; indicate severe turbulence.

- **Virga:**

  - Precipitation falling from a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground (commonly seen below cirrus or altostratus).

- **Contrails (Condensation Trails):**
  - Artificial line clouds formed by aircraft exhaust in cold, humid upper-tropospheric air.

> **Location:** University Meteorology Field Station  
> **Sky:** 70% covered  
> **Cloud Type(s):**

> **Notes:**

> - Visibility reduced to ~5 km.
> - Continuous precipitation expected to last several hours.
> - Barometric pressure falling (1012 hPa → 1008 hPa over past 6 h), confirming warm front passage.

## 7. Cloud Indicators & Weather Forecasting

- **Cirrus / Cirrostratus →** Often indicate moisture/advection at high altitudes; may precede warm or occluded fronts in 24–48 h.
- **Altocumulus Castellanus →** Sign of mid-level instability; afternoon thunderstorms likely.
- **Altostratus / Nimbostratus →** Widespread precipitation, typically stratiform; signal passage of warm front or mature low-pressure system.
- **Stratus →** Stable air mass, often post-frontal or in marine-inversion conditions; light drizzle or fog.
- **Cumulus (Humilis to Congestus) →** Convection-driven; growth from humilis to congestus to cumulonimbus indicates intensifying instability.
- **Lenticular Clouds (Altocumulus Lenticularis) →** Form in mountain wave conditions; strong winds aloft; usually stable otherwise.

## 8. Cloud Height Estimation Techniques

1. **Ceilometer / LIDAR:** Laser-based remote sensing to measure base height.
2. **Pilot Balloon (Pibal):** Track ascent of helium balloon, note time to disappear into cloud; estimate height.
3. **Cloud Spotter & Simple Trigonometry:**
   - Stand a known distance from a cloudbank, measure angle of elevation (using clinometer).
   - Height ≈ (Distance to cloud) × tan(θ).

## 9. Cloud Cover Notation (Oktas)

- **0/8:** Clear sky (no clouds)
- **1–2/8:** Few clouds
- **3–4/8:** Scattered clouds
- **5–7/8:** Broken sky (mostly cloudy)
- **8/8:** Overcast

> **Example:** 4/8 Altocumulus + 3/8 Cumulus = Partly cloudy conditions.

## 10. Artificial Clouds & Human Influence

- **Contrails →** Can spread into cirrus-like “contrail cirrus,” affecting local radiation budget.
- **Cloud Seeding →** Introduction of silver iodide or dry ice to induce ice-phase formation; used to enhance precipitation or dissipate fog.
- **Pollution Particulates →** Increase condensation nuclei concentration → smaller droplet size → potential for aerosol indirect effect (cloud albedo modification).

## 12. Mnemonics & Tips for Identification

- **“Cirrus = Curl of Hair”** → Thin, hair-like streaks
- **“Alto = Almost Anywhere in Mid-Sky”** → Look for grayish sheets/puffs at eye level or a bit higher
- **“Stratus = Static, Stuck Close”** → Low, uniform layers that cling to hills/mountains
- **“Cumulus = Cotton”** → Puffy, well-defined; if growing tall → watch for storms
- **“Nimbus = Nuisance Rain”** → Dark, ragged underside with steady precipitation
